# Making games for streamers seems hard as f***

Remember the old days where we would immerse us selfs while reading books?  

I don't... I suck at books.  

![Person laughing](haha.svg)  

But you know the feeling, right? We just have to change books for movies/games/sports...  

Pretty sure that after title and text above, you can guess everything that I'm going to write about (if you reflect deep enough, you don't even have to read this post...).  

## Storytelling

What theaters, movie theaters and libraries have in common? When you make noise people go "Shh".  

![Person making "shhhh!"](shh.svg)  

I'm joking... They are storytelling places.  

Where you go to read/watch/see/hear a predetermined story and the author try to build a path for how you should feel in that storytelling (sometimes is not even close).  

Video games are storytelling? If you put a story in it... Yes! They may not be the best storytelling because it's hard to control what players feel, but that's why people insert cinematics in games. 

Cinematics are a way of telling a story without letting you ruin everything (dramatic). Just think about what stupid thing players could if you let them free in the cinematic (probably throw them self from a high place... I don't know).  

People love to test the boundaries of the games or try to find something that the [author didn't count on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZXCgZZn6jg).  

Anyway, I'm getting of track. It's harder than movies and books because it's not just storytelling but it's still possible to do a great job at it.

Not saying that storytelling is easy, just that when you have to take in count everything that the player can do... Telling a good story become difficult.  

Think about a great book or movie that somebody attempt to transform into a game... It's really hard to tell the same story. The developer may want them to feel like a great hero, but maybe they are pissed after dying 20 times to the same boss.

## Immerse our selfs

Remember when I joked about places that people "Shh" you? I wasn't joking.  

![Person watching a monitor/tv](watching.svg)  

Is kinda obvious that people "Shh" in that places because it's really hard to immerse in something but it's very easy to lose focus.  

When I say "immerse", think about the situation that you are so focus in something that you ignore somebody calling your name.  

Obviously is important for storytelling games (except comedy that is a free ticket for "f*ck it" town) but it's also important for competitive games! You don't have immerse yourself in feelings but in the game mechanics (thinking about everything that the other play can do).  

That's probably why we get more **angry** or **sad** after losing a competitive game where we invest us self to win. Over time we learn to manage this feelings better but still not a happy feeling.

Err... Not even fustrated? Are you sure that you were invested in the game? Maybe you just didn't care about the game.

## Attention problem

Attention is a limited resource... We can't make 20 tasks at same time and get the same quality of making one with all our attention (exceptions exist but I don't think you are one of them).  

![Person being distracted](attention.svg)  
<sub>(It was suppose to be someone getting distract and dying in the game...)</sub>  

Classic example is your parents trying to talk to you while you are playing, in this cases you attempt to multitask between playing and anwering them (if you are like me, you are probably dead in the game).  

In case of games/movies/books storytelling the same can happen... How can you get in the horror games mood of "I'm going to die, I want to run" if you have to stop to do something for your parents just before the scary moment.  

:::note
> Stop blaming the player, is also devs fault.

You want me to blame developers? Okay, It's also developers fault for not making a great storytelling that lock you into the screen... But this post is more about our problem, I can't just start bad mouthing developers now (this post would get BIG and I don't have time to complain about everyone (I actually have... I'm unemployed... Sad...)).

## Streamers

> "Making games for streamers seems hard as f***"

How do you capture the attention of someone who may stop to read others people messages and thinking about an answer to them?  

How do you reproduce into another the feeling that you had when children where you would play in front of TV without noticing your parents calling you?  

How do you tell about the struggles of your character if the other person is busy reflecting their life to other people?  

Streamers are not "just" players, they are entertainment too! This means that they need to share the attention with their viewers.  

- Look at the chat to check if the stream didn't go offline
- Interact with the chat to show that he cares about them
- Thanks the subscribers/donations
- Express what is in their mind while playing because the viewers want to know

I'm not here to blame anyone, just to point the difficulties.  

Compared to other options to play the game:  

- Playing the game alone in the room
    - You don't have to say a word
- Recording a video for youtube
    - People normally want to know what is in your mind
    - I didn't reflect enough about this so I don't have another points... Sorry youtubers

## Conclusion

I don't have any...  

What don't know how developers attack this... They invest less in long immersive momments? They do more short contents? They always assume that the player is a streamer? I mean, you can't just ignore the fact that a streamer could bad mouth your game (this can affect sales, right?).
