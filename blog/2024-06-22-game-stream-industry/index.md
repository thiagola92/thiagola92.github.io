# Making games for streamers seems hard as f***

Remember the old days where we would immerse us selfs while reading books?  

I don't... I suck at books.  

![Person laughing](haha.svg)  

But you know the feeling, right? We just have to change books for movies/games/sports...  

Pretty sure that after title and text above, you can guess everything that I'm going to write about (if you reflect deep enough, you don't even have to read this post...).  

## Storytelling

What theaters, movie theaters and libraries have in common? When you make noise people go "Shh".  

![Person making "shhhh!"](shh.svg)  

I'm joking... They are storytelling places.  

Where you go to read/watch/see/hear a predetermined story and the author try to build a path for how you should feel in that storytelling (sometimes is not even close).  

Video games are storytelling? If you put a story in it... Yes! They may not be the best storytelling because it's hard to control what players feel, but that's why people insert cinematics in games. 

Cinematics are a way of telling a story without letting you ruin everything (dramatic). Just think about what stupid thing players could if you let them free in the cinematic (probably throw them self from a high place... I don't know).  

People love to test the boundaries of the games or try to find something that the [author didn't count on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZXCgZZn6jg).  

Anyway, I'm getting of track. It's harder than movies and books because it's not just storytelling but it's still possible to do a great job at it.

Not saying that storytelling is easy, just that when you have to take in count everything that the player can do... Telling a good story become difficult.  

Think about a great book or movie that somebody attempt to transform into a game... It's really hard to tell the same story. The developer may want them to feel like a great hero, but maybe they are pissed after dying 20 times to the same boss.

## Immerse our selfs

Remember when I joked about places that people "Shh" you? I wasn't joking.  

![Person watching a monitor/tv](watching.svg)  

Is kinda obvious that people "Shh" in that places because it's really hard to immerse in something but it's very easy to lose focus.  

When I say "immerse", think about the situation that you are so focus in something that you ignore somebody calling your name.  

Obviously is important for storytelling games (except comedy that is a free ticket for "f*ck it" town) but it's also important for competitive games! You don't have immerse yourself in feelings but in the game mechanics (thinking about everything that the other play can do).  

That's probably why we get more **angry** or **sad** after losing a competitive game where we invest us self to win. Over time we learn to manage this feelings better but still not a happy feeling.

> "I don't get sad or angry"

Err... Not even fustrated? Are you sure that you were invested in the game? Maybe you just didn't care about the game.

## Attention problem

Attention is a limited resource... We can't make 20 tasks at same time and get the same quality of making one with all our attention.  

Losing attention only for one second could end the immersion (it's not as bad it sound... it's just annyoing). Tell me that you never attempted to show a cool video and your friend lost attention before the best part.  
Noise in this places can make you lose attention for a second... This could end your immersion in the book or make you lose an essential part of the movie. To tell you the truth, it's already hard for focus when there is no noise.
