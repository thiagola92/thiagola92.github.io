This is because, for reference counting, you have to pass around a memory address in order to refer to the variable (because there is only one instance of the variable), and then getting the variable involves looking up the memory address. But for primitive numeric values such as int, float, or bool, passing the direct value takes just as much memory (less than 64 bits or 8 bytes) as passing a memory address.

This topic is quite advanced for people who may be learning programming for the first time, but: in stuff like C# (Unity), memory is \"garbage collected\", i.e. the program tracks memory for you and auto-deletes it on your behalf. This can lead to random pauses in a game if the garbage collector suddenly starts up and interrupts gameplay to clean up memory. Object pooling, i.e. creating a group of objects and then just cycling through them rather than deleting and creating constantly, was a strategy to re-use existing memory for objects so as to stop the garbage collector from needing to run in the first place. But Godot does memory allocation manually and in small increments. It is designed in such a way that constantly creating and deleting objects doesn't lead to long-term memory fragmentation, i.e. it doesn't mess up your computer. You can read about this in the \"development\" section of the official documentation. Anyway, object pooling IS useful if, for performance reasons, you don't want to waste TIME deleting and creating large objects, but you won't need to worry about stuttering or memory issues, so most of the time, it's perfectly fine in Godot to just create and delete objects as you need them."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"*Algumas adapta\xe7\xf5es foram feitas para melhorar aleitura (adicionar nova linha, transformar em bullet points, etc) mas nenhuma altera\xe7\xe3o em palavras ou frases foram feitas."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"reference",children:"Reference"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LaB6wbZepg",children:"Video com o coment\xe1rio"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7uU5XaPB9uYKlowYOhEHnA",children:"A pessoa do coment\xe1rio tem um canal que fala bem sobre Godot"})}),"\n"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},11151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>s,a:()=>i});var a=n(67294);const o={},r=a.createContext(o);function i(e){const t=a.useContext(r);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),a.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
